Write a Bowling program that will allow the user to enter any number of bowling scores (integers between 0 and 300).  The user will enter a -1 to signal that they are done entering scores.  The application will then return the percentage of bowlers who are elite (Scores 200+) and average bowlers (less than 200). 



You output should look similar to below:



Please enter the bowling score (-1 to quit):189
Please enter the bowling score (-1 to quit):193
Please enter the bowling score (-1 to quit):213
Please enter the bowling score (-1 to quit):-1

Elite Bowlers 33.3%
Average Bowlers 66.7%

HINT: Ask for the first grade and then start the loop. Ask for the next grade inside the loop at the end.
